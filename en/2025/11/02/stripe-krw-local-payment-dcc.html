                    <p>Every time you pay on an overseas website, you've probably seen that little popup asking if you'd like to pay in KRW or USD. That's DCC — Dynamic Currency Conversion. It sounds convenient, but in reality it almost always costs you more. The merchant or payment processor uses its own exchange rate and adds a markup on top. So, in most cases, it's much cheaper to just pay in the local currency (USD, EUR, etc.). Paying in KRW on a foreign site basically means paying extra for nothing.</p>

<p>Stripe once planned to enter the Korean market — they even started hiring — but eventually went quiet. Maybe it's because of Korea's complex financial regulations or the already-saturated PG market, but things have moved slower than expected. Still, starting in late 2024, Stripe's documentation finally began mentioning support for Korean local payments. According to their docs, Checkout and Elements now support Korean credit and debit cards, as well as popular local wallets like Naver Pay, Kakao Pay, Samsung Pay, and Payco. Sounds like good news, right? But once you actually try it, it's clear that “it's not as simple as it sounds.” Many of those options require your Stripe account to be registered under a Korean entity or a U.S.-based legal entity. So technically it's “available,” but in practice, not fully open yet.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://pocu.academy/en">POCU Academy</a>'s perspective, it's kind of a funny situation. We currently sell courses in two ways: the <a href="https://pocu.academy/en/Courses">regular semester (full courses) are sold directly through our own website</a> operated by a Canadian corporation, and the <a href="https://pocu-en.teachable.com/l/products">on-demand video lectures are sold through the U.S. platform Teachable</a>. Both use Stripe for payments. And both still have DCC attached. At first, I hoped that since Stripe started supporting Korean payments, maybe DCC would finally disappear — but nope, it's still there. For <a href="https://pocu.academy/en">POCU Academy</a>, which runs under a Canadian entity, that's understandable. But for a U.S.-based company like Teachable, it was surprising. When I looked more closely at the receipt, I found that Teachable's Stripe account is registered under a Netherlands entity. So it's using an EU-based Stripe setup, meaning it doesn't yet utilize the U.S. Stripe infrastructure that supports Korean local payments. I think Teachable's parent company might actually be based in the Netherlands? If that's true, it probably simplifies handling payments across EU countries, even if it complicates things for Korea.</p>

<p>Stripe usually rolls out new features in this order: U.S. → Europe → Canada. So maybe Teachable will get the DCC-free benefit first, and then POCU Academy will follow. The reason European and Canadian entities don't yet have access is that each country's banking and card networks have to be interconnected. For instance, when a Korean customer pays in KRW, Stripe has to accept that payment through a Korean acquiring bank, then later settle it in the merchant's home currency (say, CAD). The bank that processes the payment and the one that handles settlement may be in completely different countries. Because of this, foreign exchange regulations and anti-money-laundering laws prevent Stripe from directly converting and remitting funds — it must route them through local partner banks. To fully open local payments in Korea, Stripe can't just flip a switch; it has to partner with Korean banks and card networks while ensuring its overseas settlement rails align. And since the Korean won isn't a fully free-floating international currency, those connections take extra time and red tape. In short, for Stripe to truly make “local currency in, foreign currency out” seamless, both domestic and international banking infrastructures have to work together.</p>

<p>We've known about the DCC issue for a long time, so we've already priced our KRW courses lower than their USD or CAD equivalents to offset it. Still, it's a little awkward when the price you see on-screen and the final charged amount don't perfectly match. To make things more confusing, whether DCC is applied depends on the card issuer — some cards add it, others don't. Since it varies by card network and policy, customers can't really predict what will happen until they see the charge.</p>

<p>So for now, it's a waiting game. We've waited this long, so waiting a little more isn't a big deal.</p>

<p>There's even an ironic twist. Some people have managed to beat DCC losses by stacking overseas-payment point-back promotions — for example, when Naver Pay offered cash-back on international transactions. In a few cases, the rewards outweighed the DCC markup, turning what should've been a loss into a profit. It's not a structural fix, just a lucky promotion timing, but still amusing. Koreans are good at finding these little loopholes.</p>

<p>To sum up, Stripe has officially started supporting Korean local payments, and on paper everything's ready. But to actually feel it in practice, Stripe still needs to complete its settlement infrastructure with Korean partner banks. Without local banks backing the KRW side, the flow from a KRW payment to an overseas settlement currency can't be fully automated. Once Stripe secures enough local partners and streamlines cross-border settlements, that's when true DCC-free local payments will finally become reality.</p>
