                    <p>One day, while browsing the shelves at the library, I stumbled upon a book that caught my eye. The title was <em>Engineering in Plain Sight</em> (by Grady Hillhouse). Honestly, at first I just thought the illustrations were pretty, and the first few pages looked fun, so I picked it up lightly, assuming it was just some kind of illustrated reference book.</p>

<p>But the more I read, the more surprised I became. It wasn't just a catalog of "roads, bridges, drains," but a book that revealed in a completely different light the things we've <strong>taken for granted since birth, simply because they've always been there.</strong></p>

<p>As I turned the pages, I realized that all of this infrastructure exists thanks to <em>design, labor, and government investment</em>. Before, I would vaguely think, "Managing all these roads and structures must require a lot of taxes. Taxes aren't a waste." But this book made that thought more concrete and real. It's not just that "it costs a lot of money," but I came to understand <strong>the principles, the methods, and the reasons why maintenance is essential.</strong></p>

<h2 id="power-and-communication-networks">Power and Communication Networks</h2>

<p>The early chapters cover <strong>power and communication networks</strong>, and this is where my perspective started to change. The electricity and internet we use daily without a second thought are, in fact, supported by massive infrastructure. What impressed me most was how the story moved from <strong>older communication networks all the way to modern cellular towers.</strong> From the cables strung along utility poles to the silver masts scattered throughout the city, I realized these weren't just random or decorative objects. Suddenly, ordinary scenery began to take on meaning.</p>

<h2 id="roads-and-tunnels">Roads and Tunnels</h2>

<p>The middle chapters focus on <strong>roads and tunnels.</strong> I never realized how much engineering went into the asphalt we drive on every day. Drainage design, paving materials, even the way lane markings are drawn—all of it has a reason. The tunnel section, with its explanation of ventilation systems, lighting, and fire escape passages, was especially eye-opening. I used to think of tunnels as nothing more than "cramped spaces," but now when I pass through one, I notice the ceiling fans and realize those emergency exits aren't just for show.</p>

<h2 id="water-supply-and-sewage-yes-poop">Water Supply and Sewage (Yes, Poop!)</h2>

<p>My personal favorite section was the one about <strong>water supply and sewage—yes, the poop chapter!</strong> I always thought clean water came out of the tap and wastewater just went "down the drain," but behind that is centuries of accumulated engineering. The book's diagrams of pipes, treatment processes, and purification facilities made me realize, "Wow, it's thanks to this complex and carefully designed system that we can live comfortably and safely." Honestly, it was so fascinating that I found myself chuckling while reading. <em>"This is the hidden world of poop!"</em> 😂</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<p>The final chapter (Chapter 8) covers <strong>construction</strong>, and this part felt a little underwhelming. Heavy machinery and construction sites are interesting in their own right, but coming right after the unforgettable sewage chapter, it felt less impactful by comparison. Not bad, but for me, Chapter 7 was so strong that Chapter 8 felt more like a bonus.</p>

<h2 id="closing-the-book">Closing the Book</h2>

<p>After finishing this book, my perspective has definitely changed. Where before I only vaguely thought "this must cost a lot of taxes," now I connect what I see with the <strong>specific systems and human effort</strong> behind it all. When I walk down the street, manhole covers, traffic lights, drains, and cell towers all catch my eye, and I think, "Ah, that's exactly what I saw in the book." It's become a private little joy. Others might pass by without noticing, but now I know the meaning—and that's surprisingly fun.</p>

<p>More than anything, this book gave me a sense of <strong>humility and gratitude.</strong> From the unseen sewage pipes carrying waste to the steel frameworks that hold up our cities, it's thanks to the expertise and hard work of countless people that I can live safely and comfortably each day.</p>

<p>That's why I want to recommend this book especially to developers like me, who spend our lives tapping on keyboards. Don't just stare at the virtual world inside a computer. Turn your eyes to the real world beneath your feet. Step away from the "shallow perspective of a software engineer" and, at least for a moment, adopt the mindset of a <strong>civil engineer hauling sewage</strong> to keep the city running. That is the greatest gift this book has to offer.</p>

<p>After all, we live in the <strong>real world, don't we?</strong></p>

<p>So I can say this with confidence:</p>

<p>👉 <em>Engineering in Plain Sight</em> — definitely worth a read.</p>
