The title was <em>Engineering in Plain Sight</em> (by Grady Hillhouse). Honestly, at first I just thought the illustrations were pretty, and the first few pages looked fun, so I picked it up lightly, assuming it was just some kind of illustrated reference book.</p>

<p>But the more I read, the more surprised I became. It wasn't just a catalog of "roads, bridges, drains," but a book that revealed in a completely different light the things we've <strong>taken for granted since birth, simply because they've always been there.</strong></p>

<p>As I turned the pages, I realized that all of this infrastructure exists thanks to <em>design, labor, and government investment</em>. Before, I would vaguely think, "Managing all these roads and structures must require a lot of taxes. Taxes aren't a waste." But this book made that thought more concrete and real. It's not just that "it costs a lot of money," but I came to understand <strong>the principles, the methods, and the reasons why maintenance is essential.</strong></p>

<h2 id="power-and-communication-networks">Power and Communication Networks</h2>

<p>The early chapters cover <strong>power and communication networks</strong>, and this is where my perspective started to change. The electricity and internet we use daily without a second thought are, in fact, supported by massive infrastructure. What impressed me most was how the story moved from <strong>older communication networks all the way to modern cellular towers.</strong> From the cables strung along utility poles to the silver masts scattered throughout the city, I realized these weren't just random or decorative objects. Suddenly, ordinary scenery began to take on meaning.</p>

<h2 id="roads-and-tunnels">Roads and Tunnels</h2>

<p>The middle chapters focus on <strong>roads and tunnels.</strong> I never realized how much engineering went into the asphalt we drive on every day. Drainage design, paving materials, even the way lane markings are drawnâ€”all of it has a reason. The tunnel section, with its explanation of ventilation systems, lighting, and fire escape passages, was especially eye-opening. I used to think of tunnels as nothing more than "cramped spaces," but now when I pass through one, I notice the ceiling fans and realize those emergency exits aren't just for show.</p>

<h2 id="water-supply-and-sewage-yes-poop">Water Supply and Sewage (Yes, Poop!)</h2>

<p>My personal favorite section was the one about <strong>water supply and sewageâ€”yes, the poop chapter!</strong> I always thought clean water came out of the tap and wastewater just went "down the drain," but behind that is centuries of accumulated engineering. The book's diagrams of pipes, treatment processes, and purification facilities made me realize, "Wow, it's thanks to this complex and carefully designed system that we can live comfortably and safely." Honestly, it was so fascinating that I found myself chuckling while reading. <em>"This is the hidden world of poop!"</em> ðŸ˜‚</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<p>The final chapter (Chapter 8) covers <strong>construction</strong>, and this part felt a little underwhelming. Heavy machinery and construction sites are interesting in their own right, but coming right after the unforgettable sewage chapter, it felt less impactful by comparison. Not bad, but for me, Chapter 7 was so strong that Chapter 8 felt more like a bonus.</p>

<h2 id="closing-the-book">Closing the Book</h2>

<p>After finishing this book, my perspective has definitely changed. Where before I only vaguely thought "this must cost a lot of taxes," now I connect what I see with the <strong>specific systems and human effort</strong> behind it all. When I walk down the street, manhole covers, traffic lights, drains, and cell towers all catch my eye, and I think, "Ah, that's exactly what I saw in the book." It's become a private little joy. Others might pass by without noticing, but now I know the meaningâ€”and that's surprisingly fun.</p>

<p>More than anything, this book gave me a sense of <strong>humility and gratitude.</strong> From the unseen sewage pipes carrying waste to the steel frameworks that hold up our cities, it's thanks to the expertise and hard work of countless people that I can live safely and comfortably each day.</p>

<p>That's why I want to recommend this book especially to developers like me, who spend our lives tapping on keyboards. Don't just stare at the virtual world inside a computer. Turn your eyes to the real world beneath your feet. Step away from the "shallow perspective of a software engineer" and, at least for a moment, adopt the mindset of a <strong>civil engineer hauling sewage</strong> to keep the city running. That is the greatest gift this book has to offer.</p>

<p>After all, we live in the <strong>real world, don't we?</strong></p>

<p>So I can say this with confidence:</p>

<p>ðŸ‘‰ <em>Engineering in Plain Sight</em> â€” definitely worth a read.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pope Kim</name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="book" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One day, while browsing the shelves at the library, I stumbled upon a book that caught my eye.

While tipping may be seen as a way to show appreciation for good service, it has become a problematic and unsustainable practice in Canada. In this blog post, I will explore the issue of tipping culture in Canada, as well as how it compares to other countries around the world.</p>

<p>One important point to note is that food service workers in Canada are entitled to the minimum wage, unlike in the United States where the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is much lower than the regular minimum wage. While this may alleviate some of the issues with tipping culture in Canada, it does not eliminate them entirely.</p>

<p>Firstly, tipping puts an undue burden on the customer. It is the responsibility of the employer to pay their employees a fair wage, and it is not up to the customer to make up the difference. Relying on customers to pay a large portion of a worker's salary creates an uneven playing field for employees, where their wages can vary depending on how generous the customers are feeling that day. This inconsistency is particularly unfair to those who work in the service industry, where they may not have the same level of control over their tips as those in other industries.</p>

<p>Secondly, tipping culture can create an unnecessary social pressure on the customer. Customers are expected to tip, even if they received poor service or if the tipping amount is not clear. This pressure can lead to awkward social situations where the customer may feel obligated to tip, even if they cannot afford to. Additionally, tipping culture can lead to discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, and age. Studies have shown that servers receive higher tips from customers who are white, male, and middle-aged, which creates an unfair playing field for those who do not fit into those categories.</p>

<p>Lastly, tipping culture can create an unsustainable work environment for those in the service industry. The uncertainty of tips can create a lot of stress and financial insecurity for workers. It can also incentivize employers to pay lower wages, as they know their employees will make up the difference through tips. This leads to a cycle where workers are expected to work longer hours or take on multiple jobs to make ends meet, which can lead to burnout and a lack of work-life balance.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that tipping culture varies widely around the world. While Canada and the United States are known for their reliance on tips, there are many countries where tipping is not expected or is even considered rude. In some countries, a service charge may be automatically included in the bill, eliminating the need for customers to calculate a tip. In other countries, it is customary to round up the bill to the nearest whole number as a gesture of appreciation for good service.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while tipping culture may be deeply ingrained in certain countries like Canada and the United States, it is important to recognize that it is not a universal practice. By understanding the nuances of tipping culture around the world, we can work towards creating more equitable and sustainable systems for workers in the service industry. However, in Canada, it is clear that tipping culture is a problematic and unsustainable practice that should be thrown away. Employers should be responsible for paying their employees a fair wage, and customers should not feel pressured to tip.</p>

<p>Instead, a more equitable and sustainable system would involve including a service charge in the price of the meal, which would be distributed fairly among all workers. This would eliminate the need for customers to calculate a tip, and provide a stable and fair income for those in the industry. Employers would then be responsible for paying their employees a proper wage that reflects the value of their work. Other countries have already embraced this approach, and there is no reason why Canada cannot do the same. It's time to move towards a more equitable and sustainable system for the benefit of all involved.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pope Kim</name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="culture" /><category term="money" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tipping culture is a contentious topic across the globe, and Canada is no exception.

<p>This shows low, median, high hourly wages and the data is pretty up-to-date. (for example, BC stat is from 2011-2012). To calculate the annual salary out of this, simply use this formula:</p>

<p>Alberta, the oil nation, comes in first, followed by BC and ON. If you are my neighbour living in BC, you should make:</p>

</div>

<p>I was like.. "Really? You can have a pet fox?". So I called my brother, Google, and did some reasearch. And yeah it's possible while it's quite restrictive. This PopSci article, posted in Oct 2012, explains it very well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-10/fyi-domesticated-foxes">Popular Science Article: Can I Have A Pet Fox?</a></p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There's distinction between tamed and domesticated animals</li>
  <li>You can tame animals by training them since they were young. So if you tame an wild fox, she won't bite you, but she won't play with you. In other words, no ball chasing.. no belly rubbingâ€¦ no wiggling. Most importantly, the offsprings of tamed animals need to be tamed again.</li>
  <li>Domesticated animals are the result from very selective breeding of "human-friendly" wild foxes. They act more like dogs. It's in their DNA, so their children will love you too :)</li>
  <li>The only way you can buy domesticated foxes are from Russia. They've been doing this selective breeding since 1950s, so after tens of generations those foxes are really dog-like.</li>
  <li>The price is about $6,000</li>
  <li>One interesting thing though: those domesticated foxes are showing some physical difference from pure wild counterparts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I finally watched James Cameron's Avatar the other day on DVD. It was a good movie, but the DVD quality was not that great on my 1080p display. It's after all 480P right? Now people are used to 1080P, so DVD quality wouldn't cut it. (even youtube video looks better than DVD, jesus!)</p>

<p>So then what's next? will we need anything over 1080p? I believe the common belief was that our eyes can't process more than a few million pixels so going over 1080p would be waste.(1080P is about 2 million pixels) <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YesIKnowThat/posts/LToL7NFHU4r">But apparently we can perceive way more than thatâ€¦.</a> So we will need more than 1080P.</p>

<p>But one day TV resolutions will overcome our eyes' capabilitiesright? Then can we stop adding more pixels on the TV? I don't think our eyes are the limit.. the manufacturing cost would be the deciding factor.. Say our eyes can only process 1,000 million pixels. But if we are given a TV with 4,000 million pixels, our eyes will see 4 pixels as one pixel. right? So it would be same as blending those 4 pixels into 1. Oh sweet! it's a 4X super sampling antialiasing! If it's gets 16,000 million pixels it's 16x SSAA.. I can't say no to this.. :)</p>

<p>But as I said, it might become too expensive to add that many pixels one dayâ€¦ but price of LEDs are going down everyday and smart people are making LEDs use less power. so that might not be a problemâ€¦. or it might become physically impossible to add more pixels one day? just like how we coudln't make single-core CPUs faster anymore? Maybeâ€¦. but still 576 Million pixels are long way to goâ€¦.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pope Kim</name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="graphics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[some random thought I had while sitting on a bench at a rainy park todayâ€¦.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Surviving Winter in Montreal - Snowfall - ALOT</title><link href="https://blog.popekim.com/en/2012/12/28/surviving-winter-in-montreal-snowfall.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Surviving Winter in Montreal - Snowfall - ALOT" /><published>2012-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://blog.popekim.com/en/2012/12/28/surviving-winter-in-montreal-snowfall</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.popekim.com/en/2012/12/28/surviving-winter-in-montreal-snowfall.html"><![CDATA[<p>So yesterday we had some snow.. I mean.. somewhat alotâ€¦. 45 to 50 Cm a day. fun eh?</p>

<p>First I shoveled the pathway in front of my houseâ€¦ it took me about 30 mins.</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2012/12/00.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then I moved to my backyard/parking lot. I spent about 2~3 hours to clear 2/3 of the parking lot until I had to go out for my Thursday ritual: pub crawl with one of my buddies here. The city does really good job at cleaning major roads. All those snow piles at the curbside will be removed by city in coming days. I was told it would take about a week this time.</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2012/12/01.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One nice thing about having a heavy snow was that there were not many people at the pub. So it was quiet and cozy: just how I like. Yum~</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2012/12/02.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So while having a couple of drinks, I asked my friend if it's common to have this much snow. He said <strong>"Yeah, this is decent.."</strong> So I thought 'okay I have to be prepared for worse snowfalls and shoveling'â€¦ Butâ€¦ now I'm watching a news while writing this blog post. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/montrealers-takes-snow-in-stride-as-storm-smashes-1971-record/article6758046/">It says it was the record high snow fall for a single day in Montreal history</a>. I'm gonna go f**king kick his assâ€¦ :P  Oh well, the good news is that now I know i can survive the worst snowfall here.. right?</p>

<p>By the way, I shoveled about 3 more hours today to finish my parking lot.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pope Kim</name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="canada" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yesterday we had some snow..
