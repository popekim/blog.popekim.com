<p>People who heard it were split into two very different groups: Some said it sounded hopeful, while others said it felt depressing.</p>

And this is one of the recordings we did… (or should I say Dale did because he's the only one doing all the voice acting?)</p>

<p>It's been in my HDD for the last 2 years, and I finally decided to edit it to show it to the world because it's hilarious. Enjoy</p>

The closest one was <a href="http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/d/damien_rice/wild_and_free_crd.htm">this</a>, but still not 100% correct.</p>

<p>So I just did it by myself…. Enjoy.. if you know how to play guitar and you are a fan of Damian Rice just like me. For lyrics, take a look at the above link. meh…</p>

<pre><code>verse e - bm - c#m - g#m&lt;/span&gt;

prechrous a - e - bm - c#m&lt;/span&gt;

chrus f#m - c#m&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(Damian does a simple finger trick with the last c#m chord. Lift and press again fourth finger at the first time and then fifth finger at the 2nd time)</p>]]></content><author><name>Pope Kim</name></author><category term="music" /><category term="music" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to find the correct guitar chords for Wild and Free by Damian Rice for a while without any success.
